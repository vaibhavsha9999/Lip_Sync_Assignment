# Wav2Lip Lipsyncing Tool

This repository contains code for a Lipsyncing tool using the Wav2Lip model. This tool allows you to synchronize an audio track with a video of a person's face to create a realistic lipsync effect.

## Instructions

Before running this code, please follow these steps:

1. Switch to GPU: Ensure you are using a GPU runtime for this code to work efficiently.
2. Download Files: Download the following files and place them in the main Colab directory:
   - [Audio File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_Cdx3QJQqu1vr8gmpwC6aoIPjWq3FM5/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Inference Script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-GFG9Xi1EzXJP7HXGYMpYoTwueWNBUU/view?usp=sharing) (Replace the original file inside `/content/Wav2Lip` after running the setup cell.)
3. Setup Wav2Lip: Run the setup cell to install dependencies, download the pretrained model, and set up the required components.
4. Download Video: Download a video from YouTube and obtain the video ID from the URL. Replace `YOUTUBE_URL` with the desired YouTube URL in the "Downloading Video" cell.
5. Trim Video: Trim the downloaded video by specifying the start and end seconds in the "Trimming Video" cell.
6. Select and Trim Audio: Specify the path to your audio and trim it according to the video length in the "Selecting and Trimming Audio" cell.
7. Generate Video: Adjust parameters in the "Generate Video" cell if needed, and then run the cell to generate the lipsynced video.
8. Show and Download Video: View the generated video using the "Show Generated Video" cell. You can also download the video using the "Download Generated Video" cell.

## Problems and Solutions

1. Model Limitations: The model may not work properly when there is no face in the frame or when the face is just an image. This can result in lip sync issues. Some manual trimming and editing might be required to fix these cases.
2. Face Detection: The tool uses face detection to synchronize the lips. It may sometimes detect non-speaking faces or fail to detect speaking faces, leading to inaccurate results.
3. Fine-Tuning: The tool might require fine-tuning and adjustments based on the specific video and audio input to achieve optimal results.

Please note that this tool is provided as-is, and further improvements and adjustments may be needed based on your specific use case.
